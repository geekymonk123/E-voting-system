#A Cost-Efficient Online Voting System Based on Facial Recognition
The conventional voting system necessitates a significant allocation of manpower, leading to considerable expenses. This workforce is drawn from various sectors like banking, postal services, and education. Their extensive participation in activities such as pre-voting training, travel, and overseeing the entire voting process disrupts the routine operations of their respective sectors for a considerable duration. Additionally, there are concerns such as tampering of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and the improper use of ballot papers, raising doubts about the legitimacy of the voting procedure. Moreover, individuals who are not residing in their hometowns face difficulties in voting remotely. A potential remedy to address all these issues is to implement an online voting system. In online system it is important to authenticate every user to ensure that genuine voter is casting his/her vote. This  work proposes a three-layer security-based e-voting system. Firstly, voterâ€™s authenticity is validated against both Voter ID and Aadhar ID followed by OTP checking. In the next level verification is done based on face detection and recognition using Haar Cascade Clas-sifier Algorithm and Local Binary Pattern Histogram Algorithm. Each voter can access to the system only when being recognized with Registered Voter Data-base. Once the corresponding face is matched with the information provided, the voter is allowed to proceed for choosing preferred candidate from the panel. The contribution of this  work is the proposal of an authentic voting system but at a fraction of cost requiring minimal manpower.
